***It's a beta, so be extremely careful when using this software and always validate results it gives you***

**Anya** is a KBAG decryption kit for JTAGable prototypes. Here is the list of platforms currently supported:

### AP

* **M9 B0/B1** - Apple S4/S5
* **Cyprus B0/B1** - Apple A12 (B0 since beta 4)
* **Cebu B0/B1** - Apple A13
* **Sicily A0** - Apple A14 (since beta 3)

### SEP

* **M9 B0/B1** - Apple S4/S5
* **Cyprus B1** - Apple A12

***SEP** support is available since beta 5 and deeply experimental*

## Building
### Requirements
* libirecovery
* LLVM toolchain for ARM64
* Python 3

### Building
Build system is a dumpster fire, better just download a ZIP from releases, but still you can try:
```
make
```
...or to build a package (basically, a ZIP):
```
make package
```
List of environmental variables you *might* need to provide:
* `TOOLCHAIN` - path to a directory where *LLVM* toolchain binaries capable of producing ARM64 binaries is located 
* `ARM_CC` - ARM64 C compiler. Suppresses need of `TOOLCHAIN`
* `ARM_LD` - linker capable of using *linker scripts*. Suppresses need of `TOOLCHAIN`
* `ARM_OBJCOPY` - objcopy to cut out raw binary out of an ELF. Suppresses need of `TOOLCHAIN`
* `CC` - C compiler used to compile **anyactl** (client utility)
* `AR` - archiver used to build **libanya** (client library - the utility is based on it)
* `PYTHON` - Python 3 interpreter used by some build scripts
* `VALID_HANDLER_TARGETS` - list of targets to build USB DFU handler for. Current list of valid targets is **M9/B0_B1**, **Cyprus/B0**, **Cyprus/B1**, **Cebu/B1** and **Sicily/A0**
* `VALID_SEP_HANDLER_TARGETS` - list of targets to build SEP mailbox handler for. Current list of valid targets is **M9/B0_B1** and **Cyprus/B1**

In the end you'll get a structure like this in the `build/` folder:
```
anya.ax
anyactl
payloads/
payloads/anya_handler.M9-B0_B1.bin
payloads/anya_handler.Sicily-A0.bin
payloads/anya_handler.Cyprus-B0.bin

python/anyafromjson
sep_payloads/
sep_payloads/anya_sep_handler.M9-B0_B1.bin
sep_payloads/anya_sep_handler.Cyprus-B1.bin
```

## Usage
### Requirements
* Compiled Anya
* Astris (Yukon tools or later)

### Usage
First of all, you need to put your device into Anya mode (basically SecureROM DFU with custom USB control request handler) via Astris:
```
ANYA_PAYLOAD=path/to/desired/payload astris --script path/to/anya.ax
```
***Warning**: this will force reset your device! Better put your device into iBoot recovery or SecureROM DFU mode before doing this! On devices with a display the DFU mode is strictly recommended, otherwise you'll see weird glitches on it or even potentially damage it!*

Upon successful execution you will get a log like this one:
```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % ANYA_PAYLOAD=build/payloads/anya_handler.Cyprus-B1.bin astris --script build/anya.ax
astris v2.7.2

WARNING: This version of tcl is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.
In future versions of macOS the tcl runtime will not be available by
default, and may require you to install an additional package.

Make sure **IBFL** (*iBoot Flags*) value in USB serial number has bit 6 set:
```
CPID:8020 CPRV:11 CPFM:01 SCEP:01 BDID:0E IBFL:6C ECID:REDACTED SRTG:[iBoot-3865.0.0.4.7]
```
This bit is not used by iBoot/SecureROM (except for M1, apparently), so Anya sets it to indicate a device is in Anya mode

Starting from now you can use `anyactl`, usage is quite straight-forward:
```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % build/anyactl 
usage: build/anyactl ARG[s]

where ARG[s] must be one of the following:
    -k KBAG specifies KBAG to be decrypted
    -b NUM  runs benchmark with NUM random KBAGs
    -s  uses SEP GID (if possible)

you can also use this one with both of the above:
    -e ECID (hexa)decimal ECID to look for

noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya %
```

Benchmark output example:
```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % build/anyactl -b 10000
found: CPID:8020, CPFM:01, ECID:REDACTED
decrypting...
decrypted 10000 KBAGs in 5.054345 seconds, average - 1978.495728 KBAGs/sec

```

```

***Warning**: since we're using prototype devices here, you obviously need to provide a development KBAG, not production (development one usually comes second in an Image4)!*

### SEP notes
*Available since beta 5*

If your device is *insecure* and there's SEP support for a desired platform in Anya:
```
ANYA_PAYLOAD=path/to/desired/payload ANYA_SEP_PAYLOAD=path/to/desired/sep_payload astris --script path/to/anya.ax
```
Note `ANYA_SEP_PAYLOAD` is required now

Upon successful execution you will get a log very simialar to the one without SEP support:
```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % ANYA_PAYLOAD=build/payloads/anya_handler.M9-B0_B1.bin ANYA_SEP_PAYLOAD=build/sep_payloads/anya_sep_handler.M9-B0_B1.bin astris nova --script build/anya.ax

To decrypt with SEP GID, add `-s` flag to `anyactl` (both C and Python version):
```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % build/anyactl -k 533AB83177837FAD831105140400AEB75C86C59F742292B12FA5A71749B1CD6F5948BBFE39129B9472DC6DA22C64B3F0 -s

## Python
*Available since beta 2*

### Requirements
* Python 3
* pyusb

### Library usage
Placed in `python/anya` folder. Usage is quite straightforward:

```python
from anya import *
from anya.exceptions import *

dev = AnyaDevice(ecid=ECID)	# creating connection class

try:
    dev.connect()	# connecting
except AnyaError as e:
    print("failed to connect: %s" % str(e))
    exit(-1)

try:
    sep_available = dev.ping_sep() # pinging SEP
except AnyaUSBError as e:
    print("failed to ping SEP: %s" % str(e))

try:
    decoded = decode_kbag(KBAG)	# decoding a KBAG string to bytes
except AnyaValueError as e:
    print("failed to parse KBAG: %s" % str(e))
    exit(-1)

try:
    key = dev.decrypt_kbag(decoded)	# decrypting 
except AnyaUSBError as e:
    print("failed to decrypt KBAG: %s" % str(e))
    exit(-1)

print(encode_key(key, to_upper=True)) # encoding key to a string (and printing)

dev.disconnect() # disconnecting
```

### Tools usage
Placed in `python/` folder. There're two of them - **anyactl** (basically the same thing as the C variant of the ctl):

```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % build/python/anyactl 
usage: anyactl [-h] [-k KBAG] [-b COUNT] [-s] [-e ECID]

Decrypt some KBAG or run a benchmark

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -k KBAG     decrypt a KBAG
  -b COUNT    run benchmark
  -s          use SEP GID (if possible)
  -e ECID     ECID to look for
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % 
```

...and **anyafromjson** - this one is used to decrypt KBAGs in batch from a JSON file:

```
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya % python/anyafromjson --help
usage: anyafromjson [-h] [-e ECID] [-s] [-d] in_path out_path

a dumb utility that takes KBAGs from an input JSON
and decrypts them with Anya. The input JSON must be
a list of dicts where every member must have "kbag"
field. The output JSON will be same, but with "key"
Thus, you can have arbitrary metadata in the dicts
that will be preserved in the output

to decrypt all KBAGs with SEP GID use "-s" flag, if
you wanna supply mixed file (both AP and SEP) KBAGs,
then try "-d" flag - in this case it will try to 
detect SEP KBAGs by looking at "filename" field -
if it starts with "SEP" (case does not matter),
then SEP GID is gonna be used. If none of those is
provided, everything will be decrypted with AP GID

positional arguments:
  in_path     input file
  out_path    output file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -e ECID     (hexadecimal) ECID to look for
  -s          use SEP GID (if possible)
  -d          try to detect SEP KBAGs
noone@Mac-mini-noone Anya %
```

## TODO
* Improve build system - for the current one is really bad
* Common offset database - so there won't be a need to duplicate some offsets/values in Astris script and USB handlers configs

## Credits
* @axi0mX - for the idea of replacing USB handler (used in **ipwndfu**)
* @pimskeks and other people behind **libimobiledevice** project - for **libirecovery**
* @1nsane_dev - for a lot of tests on Cebu and Sicily
* dellaquila.federica (that's Instagram handle) - for the mascot
* People behind **pongoOS** - for SEP AES decryption algorithm 
* @matteyeux - for help with SEP support for Cyprus B1
